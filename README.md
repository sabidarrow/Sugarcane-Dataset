#Sugarcane-Disease-Dataset

The Archived zip contains 3 types of data including Bacterial Blight images, Red Rod Images, and Healthy leaves Images of sugarcane. This data have been used for the Detection and Classification of sugarcane diseases. Sugarcane diseases significantly impact global markets, causing economic losses for farmers and reduced supplies for the sugar industry. We propose a YOLO-based solution with 96.67% accuracy to detect and treat sugarcane diseases early. Integrating robotics technology allows real-time monitoring, aiding farmers in disease management decisions and mitigating their impact on the market.
